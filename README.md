# List of Privacy Focused Software I Use

Having control over your data and protecting your privacy has never been more important. In the United States, consumer data privacy rights are virtually nonexistent, and many closed-source commercial platforms are rapidly [enshittifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification).

In this hostile, anti-consumer environment, the most logical response is to rely—as much as possible on self-hosted and community-driven open-source software.

My goal was to be more intentional with the software I chose to trust with my data and rely on daily. I have slowly replaced as much of the closed-source commercial software as I can with open-source, privacy-focused alternatives.

My goal has been to be intentional about the tools I trust with my personal data and depend on daily. Over time, I’ve replaced nearly all closed-source commercial software with open-source, privacy-respecting alternatives.

I leaned on [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/) while making these choices which is an excellent, independent resource for vetting privacy-focused tools. Consider this list a supplement to their recommendations. After exploring many alternatives, this is the software stack I’ve adopted on my journey toward greater digital independence.
