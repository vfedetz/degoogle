# List of Privacy Focused Software I Use

Having control over your data and digital privacy is increasingly important in today's world. Consumer data privacy rights are basically non-existant in the United States, and closed-source commercial software is [enshittifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) at an alarming rate. In a hostile anti-consumer environment such as this, the only logical option is focusing on self hosted and community-driven open source software projects as much as you can.

My goal was to be more intentional with the software I chose to trust with my data and rely on daily. I have slowly replaced as much of the closed-source commercial software as I can with open-source, privacy-focused alternatives.

[Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/) is an excellent resource for finding privacy-focused software alternatives which I referenced heavily when exploring software options. Please treat this list as a supplementary guide, showcasing what I ultimately chose for my own journey towards digital independance.
